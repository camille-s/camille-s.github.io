      <description>I read a lot of articles and blog posts about data, I have a lot of thoughts about data, and I especially have a lot of questions about data. I have snippets of little projects that try to answer some of those questions. I also have a few opinions—data should be made accessible to general audiences, especially when it&amp;rsquo;s about them. Data can be a powerful tool for communities to understand and take care of themselves, but it can also be used to inflict harm and spread disinformation.</description>

      <description>I recently decided I had collected enough snippets and convenience functions in R that rather than pasting them in Rmarkdown documents scattered all over different projects, I should bite the bullet and build a package. I’d written a package once before for work—a collection of mostly wrapper functions for making profiles of ACS data with the acs package—and while it had one or two vignettes, it had pretty poor documentation and no tests.</description>
