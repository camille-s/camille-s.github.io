      <description>I read a lot of articles and blog posts about data, I have a lot of thoughts about data, and I especially have a lot of questions about data. I have snippets of little projects that try to answer some of those questions. I also have a few opinionsâ€”data should be made accessible to general audiences, especially when it&amp;rsquo;s about them. Data can be a powerful tool for communities to understand and take care of themselves, but it can also be used to inflict harm and spread disinformation.</description>
